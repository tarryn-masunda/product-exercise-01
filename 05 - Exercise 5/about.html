    <!-- Section about HTML experience -->
    <p><strong>Starting with HTML: Building the Foundation</strong></p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>First Impressions:</strong> HTML is often the first language a beginner encounters, and it’s usually love at first sight because you see immediate results in your browser. 
        There’s a real sense of satisfaction in writing simple tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and seeing them create structure on the screen.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Challenges:</strong> After the initial excitement wears off, you realize that HTML is just a skeleton. It’s functional but not visually appealing. 
        There’s also the learning curve of understanding when and why to use tags like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. 
        At first, it’s easy to fall into the "div soup" trap where you wrap everything in <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags, but learning about semantic HTML (like using <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, etc.) makes your code cleaner and more meaningful.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Highlights:</strong> The real "aha" moments come when you complete your first structured web page. 
        Even a simple one-pager feels like a huge accomplishment as a beginner. HTML feels relatively easy to pick up, which builds confidence early on.
    </p>

    <!-- Section about CSS experience -->
    <p><strong>CSS: Adding Style and Hitting Roadblocks</strong></p>

    <p>
        <strong>First Impressions:</strong> CSS feels magical at first. With a few lines of code, you can transform a plain HTML page into something colorful, styled, and much more visually appealing. 
        Changing fonts, colors, and layouts adds personality to your website.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Challenges:</strong> CSS can get frustrating fast, especially with positioning and layout. 
        Concepts like the box model (understanding how padding, margin, and border work) and flexbox or grid layouts feel confusing at first. 
        Trying to center a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or make elements align the way you want can take hours of trial and error. 
        And then there’s responsive design — making things look good on both mobile and desktop — which adds another layer of complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Highlights:</strong> The satisfaction of overcoming CSS challenges is hard to beat. Once you understand flexbox and grid, you realize you can create sophisticated layouts without too much code. 
        And when you make your site responsive, it feels like a huge win. CSS makes you feel like an artist, even if the learning curve can be steep.
    </p>

    <!-- Section about Python experience -->
    <p><strong>Python: Diving into the World of Logic and Problem Solving</strong></p>

    <p>
        <strong>First Impressions:</strong> Python is a different experience from HTML and CSS because it’s a programming language, not a markup or styling language. 
        The syntax is clean, and it reads almost like English, which is reassuring for beginners. Python’s simplicity helps you focus on learning programming concepts without getting bogged down by complicated syntax.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Challenges:</strong> Writing Python code requires a logical mindset, which can be tough if you’re not used to thinking in terms of variables, loops, and functions. 
        Even small errors (like forgetting a colon <code>:</code> or adding an extra space) can lead to errors, and debugging can be frustrating at first. 
        Once you move past the basics, concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP), libraries, and modules can feel daunting.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Highlights:</strong> Python becomes really rewarding once you create something functional, like a basic calculator, a to-do list app, or a simple game. 
        And as you learn more, Python opens up doors to exciting fields like data analysis, web development (using frameworks like Django or Flask), and even machine learning. 
        Python also has a supportive community and countless resources, making it easier to find solutions when you’re stuck.
    </p>

    <!-- Section about integrating skills -->
    <p><strong>Bringing It All Together</strong></p>

    <p>
        <strong>Integrating HTML, CSS, and Python:</strong> As a beginner, it’s thrilling to start combining these technologies. 
        You might use HTML and CSS to build a website’s front end and then add Python on the back end with a framework like Flask to make it interactive. 
        It’s challenging, though, to juggle the different syntax and rules for each language.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Challenges:</strong> Integrating everything can lead to errors, and debugging becomes a big part of the process. 
        You spend a lot of time searching for solutions online or figuring out why something isn’t working as expected. 
        Sometimes, the sheer volume of things to learn (HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, etc.) can feel overwhelming.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Highlights:</strong> Creating a full project that combines all three is incredibly satisfying. 
        You see how HTML structures your page, CSS makes it look good, and Python brings it to life. 
        It’s like piecing together a puzzle, and the final result feels like something you’ve truly built from the ground up.
    </p>

    <!-- Section for final thoughts -->
    <p><strong>Final Thoughts for a Beginner</strong></p>

    <p>
        <strong>Patience and Persistence:</strong> Coding is a journey, and it’s rarely smooth sailing from the start. 
        There will be bugs, frustration, and lots of "why isn't this working?!" moments. But each time you solve a problem, you grow more confident.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Learning Resources:</strong> The internet is a beginner’s best friend. Sites like Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, and W3Schools are invaluable for learning basics, and Stack Overflow is the go-to for troubleshooting.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Build Projects:</strong> The best way to learn is by doing. Start with small projects, like a personal portfolio page or a simple game, and gradually increase the complexity. 
        Each project will reinforce what you know and teach you something new.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Celebrate Small Wins:</strong> Coding progress can feel slow, so it’s important to celebrate every milestone — whether it’s figuring out how to center an element in CSS or creating your first working Python script. 
        Every step forward is a win.
